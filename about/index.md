## Software preferences
### Tools
I try to use small tools, that do one thing and do it well and follow the KISS[^1] principle.  
My preferred `Linux` distribution is `Arch`[^2]. I prefer to spend hours tuning than having the whole word in my distribution.  
To handle my windows, I use `i3`[^3]... it is stupid simple and do the job, the further the mouse from my hand is the better I am.  

As shell, I felt in love with `zsh`[^4] with a bit of `oh-my-zsh`[^5] steroids. From a single window I handle all my shells, thanks to `tmux`[^6].

To edit anything which contains characters, I use `vim`[^7].  
To communicate with the world I use `mutt`[^8] for my mails and `irssi`[^9] for chatting on `IRC`.

### Languages
I use `Go`[^10] and `C`[^11]. With that you can conquere the world :)
