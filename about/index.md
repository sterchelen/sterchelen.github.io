# About me


## Me in 10 bullet points or so

* **french** living in **France** :fr:
* I am a **site reliability engineer**, doing my best to keep systems available
* I try to be **humble**, everyone is trying no?
* I love to be **out of my comfort zone** and **learn** new things
* **smile**, always... even if it's raining
* I was used to do **rock climbing** before having two childs
* I am used to **drinking coffee** to keep me awake :baby: :baby:

## Human languages
My mother tongue is french.  
I read and write english fluently. I speak in an intermediate way, living in France is not a great help.  

## Software preferences
### Tools
I try to use small tools, that follow the KISS[^1] principle.  
My preferred :heart: `Linux` distribution is `Arch`[^2].  
I use `i3`[^3] as a windows manager... it's stupid simple and do the job, the further the mouse from my hand is the better I am.  

I felt in love with the `zsh`[^4] shell with a bit of `oh-my-zsh`[^5] steroids and `tmux`[^6] to keep my shells organized.

I use `vim`[^7] to edit anything that contains characters.  
I use `mutt`[^8] for my mails and `irssi`[^9] for chatting on `IRC`.

### Languages
`Go`[^10] and `C`[^11] are my preferred languages. With that you can conquere the world :upside_down_face:
